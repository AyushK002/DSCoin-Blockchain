# DSCoin-Blockchain

In this project, I have created a Blockchain system in Java (JDK8) by using both Merkle Trees and authenticated linked lists, which is further developed to implement a personalised cryptocurrency DSCoin which is capable of cross checking and verifying transactions, finding and properly adding transaction-blocks to the longest valid chains in the blockchain, as well as handling double spending, invalid coins and malicious mining.

The HelperClasses folder contains conventional classes which have been used repeatedly throughout the Blockchain and the DSCoin files repeatedly.

The DSCoinPackage folder contains the complete implementation of the BlockChain, as well as DSCoin, along with classes like Moderator and Members to create and use profiles for creating coins as administrator, or simply sending recieving or mining coins respectively.
